## Methods and apparatus for detection of types of Leukemia using Ensemble Learning
Classify different Leukemia Types- ALL, AML, CLL, CML

Different pre-trained models are used in this work to identify different forms of leukemia. Pretrained networks such as ResNet50, VGG16, and Inception V3 are relatively simple approaches for applying ensemble learning to image analysis. The three models—ResNet50, VGG16, and Inception V3 —have been improved for feature extraction and classification.

The Raabin Leukemia dataset is used for the classification. All image samples are taken from the Raabin Leukemia dataset from patients who were referred to the medical laboratory, working with Takht-e Tavous Laboratory in Tehran, Iran. The imaging is done using a Zeiss microscope and an LG J3 smartphone camera. There is a total of 400 images of all four classes (ALL, AML, CLL, CML).
